'''You are required to implement a program that calculates the service tax on every transaction for different types of accounts: Savings, Checking, and Demat. The service tax rates are 10%, 20%, and 5% respectively.

Create an abstract class Account with three private data member variables: accountNumber of type String, balance of type double, holderName of type String, and methods display() and an abstract method calculateServiceTax() with an argument of type int and return type as double.

Create the classes CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, and DematAccount which extend the class Account. Use appropriate getters and setters for the above classes.

Input:

The input consists of a single line with the following information separated by space:

Account type (1 for Checking Account, 2 for Savings Account, 3 for Demat Account)
Holder's name
Account number
Current balance
Amount to be transferred
Output:

Output the remaining balance after the transaction.

Sample Input:

3 Rohan 562263 985.32 155

Sample Output:

Your remaining balance is Rs.822.57'''
